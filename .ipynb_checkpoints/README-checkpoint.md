Welcome! 

We are **LANDFAWL** :

**L**ooking **A**t **N**atural **D**isasters **F**or **A**ssessment of **W**ater-quality **L**evels

Our project objective was to utilize PACE OCI data to analyze coastal environments pre- and post- natural disasters (in this case, hurricanes) to understand their effects on water quality.

You can use our code to search different PACE OCI datasets through the *earthaccess* package, as well as map these results over the affected area and plot time series in the weeks before and after the disaster event.
